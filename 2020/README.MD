# Advent of Code 2020

In which I solve every Advent of Code 2020 (https://adventofcode.com/2020) while learning typescript. The Typescript doesn't really start until day 9.

Starting around day 7, if the second puzzle is significantly different from the first I break it into a separate part B file.

Most solutions happen in less than a second.m
